# Convolutional-Network-models-for-supervised-quality-recognition-of-PPG-signals

Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals recover key physiological
parameters as pulse, oximetry and ECG. In this paper, we first employ an hybrid
architecture combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
for the analysis of PPG signals to enable an automated quality recognition.
Then, we compare its performance to a simpler CNN architecture enriched with Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KAN) layers.
Our results suggest that the usage of KAN layers is effective at reducing the number of
parameters, while also enhancing the performance of CNNs when 
equipped with standard Multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers.
